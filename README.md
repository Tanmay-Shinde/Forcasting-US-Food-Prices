# Forecasting U.S. Food Prices

This paper focuses on building an accurate and reliable model to explore the temporal dynamics of food-at-home prices in the United States at a national level. By incorporating key economic factors such as purchase volume, food categories, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI), our Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM) achieves high predictive accuracy (RMSE = 0.058) and effectively forecasts price trends. The study captures category-specific effects and temporal trends, leveraging historical data to predict future price trajectories. Our model will provide policymakers, businesses, and researchers with a robust predictive framework to anticipate market dynamics, mitigate risks, and make data-driven decisions that enhance economic resilience and consumer well-being.
