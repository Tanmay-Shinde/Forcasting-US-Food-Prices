  abstract     = {Fit Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models using 'Stan'. A wide range of distributions and link functions are supported, allowing users to fit -- among others -- linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, hurdle, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include nonlinear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, meta-analytic standard errors, and quite a few more. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs. Model fit can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks and leave-one-out cross-validation. References: Bürkner (2017) <doi:10.18637/jss.v080.i01>; Carpenter et al.
